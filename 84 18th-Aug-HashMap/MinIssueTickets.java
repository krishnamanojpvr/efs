// Sri Vihaan Travels announced a family trip to Sri Nagar, for which they began 
// taking reservations. They are only offering 2 and 3 seater tickets for this trip.

// Each member of certain groups is identifiable by the group ID to which he or 
// she belongs. Each group is uniquely identified by its group ID.

// The ticket will only be issued to members of the same group, the travel 
// administration decided. It is decided that No wasted tickets will be issued 
// (i.e., If a person is alone, then he is not allowed to get a ticket).

// You are given a list of integers person_id[], where person_id[i] is the group ID 
// of ith person in the list. Your objective is to determine fewernumber of tickets 
// should be issued to cover everyone in each group. Print -1, if it is not possible.


// Input Format:
// -------------
// Line-1: Comma separated integers, Person's group-ID

// Output Format:
// --------------
// Print an integer result.


// Sample Input-1:
// ---------------
// 1,1,3,2,2,2,1,2,2,3

// Sample Output-1:
// ----------------
// 4

// Explanation: 
// ------------
// Tohey can book the tickets for all the people, as follows:
// - Issue the 3-seater ticket, to group with ID-1 of size 3.
// - Issue the 2-seater ticket, to group with ID-3 of size 2.
// - Issue the 3-seater ticket, to group with ID-2 of size 5.
// - Issue the 2-seater ticket, to group with ID-2 of size 5.
// So, you have issued 4 tickets in total.


// Sample Input-2:
// ---------------
// 1,1,1,2,2,3

// Sample Output-2:
// ----------------
// -1

// Explanation: 
// ------------
// There is a group with ID-3 of size 1. 
// The administration's ruling states that a single person cannot receive a ticket.
// So, print -1.
