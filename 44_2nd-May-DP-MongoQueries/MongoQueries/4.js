/*
Write a MongoDB aggregation query to analyze and summarize how many patients
of each type (Inpatient and Outpatient) have each kind of insurance coverage
(Full, Partial, None).
Sort the data by patient-type in ascending orders, and descending by count.

Sample output:
-------------
[
  {
    patientCount: 3,
    patientType: 'Inpatient',
    insuranceCoverage: 'Partial'
  },
  {
    patientCount: 3,
    patientType: 'Outpatient',
    insuranceCoverage: 'Partial'
  }
]


Query Reference:
-------------------

    In db.<collection>.find()/aggregate():
    	db -> Refers to the database.
    	<collection> -> Your collection name
