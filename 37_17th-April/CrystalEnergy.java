// You are given a crystal with an energy level n. Your goal is to discover all the 
// different ways this crystal could have been created by combining smaller shards.

// Each combination must:
// - Use only shards with energy values between 2 and n - 1.
// - Be represented as a list of shard values whose product equals n.
// - Use any number of shards (minimum 2), and the order doesn't matter.

// Your task is to return all unique shard combinations that can multiply together 
// to recreate the original crystal.

// Example 1:
// ---------
// Input:
// 28

// Output:
// [[2, 14], [2, 2, 7], [4, 7]]

// Example 2:
// ----------
// Input:
// 23

// Output:
// []



// Constraints:
// - 1 <= n <= 10^4
// - Only shards with energy between 2 and n - 1 can be used.
