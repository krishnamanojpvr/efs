# A merchant has two types of idols, gold and silver.
# He has arranged the idols in the form of m*n grid, 
# 	- the gold idols are represented as 1's 
# 	- the silver idols are represented as 0's.

# Your task is to find the longest consecutive arrangement of gold idols, 
# The arrangement can be either horizontal, vertical, diagonal or 
# antidiagonal, but not the combination of these.


# Input Format:
# -------------
# Line-1: Two space separated integers m and n, grid size.
# Next m lines : n space separated integers, arrangement of idols.

# Output Format:
# --------------
# Print an integer, longest arranement of gold idols.


# Sample Input:
# ---------------
# 4 5
# 1 0 1 1 1
# 0 1 0 1 0
# 1 0 1 0 1
# 1 1 0 1 1

# Sample Output:
# ----------------
# 4
